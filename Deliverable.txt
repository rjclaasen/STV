Program			1			100%			0			0.00%
TimeCrystal		0			0.00%			31			100%

Explanations for not reaching 100%:
Dungeon: Contains a method that is only used during testing, which doesn't need to be tested.
Node: Due to time constraints, we did not manage to cover everything with testing.
Other: Some parts of our program should never get called during play. Due to time constraints, we have chosen not to cover all of those.
       We also don't cover some minor functionalities, such as not using a time crystal when the player doesn't have a time crystal.
